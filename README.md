# weather-dashboard-powerbi
Power BI dashboard using WeatherAPI with Power Query (M) and DAX measures

Features:
- Current weather and 7-day forecast
- Data transformation with Power Query (M)
- Dynamic measures with DAX (average temp, rainy days, temp difference)
- Example of data preprocessing and visualization for ETL/data analysis practice

**Note:** The API key currently in the project is valid until October 14th. To refresh the dashboard after that date, you can replace it with your own key by creating one on WeatherAPI (https://www.weatherapi.com/). Update the [API_KEY] parameter in Power Query with your new key.
